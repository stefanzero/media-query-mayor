            Lee was born in 1952 in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Seattle,
            Washington. His parents immigrated to the United States from
            Taishan, Guangdong, China, in the 1930s. Lee's father, Gok Suey Lee,
            fought in the Korean War, worked as a cook, and managed a restaurant
            in Seattle. He died when Lee was 15. His mother was a seamstress and
            waitress. Lee had five siblings. He attended Franklin High School,
            before graduating summa cum laude from Bowdoin College in Maine in
            1974, completed a year overseas as a Watson Fellow, and then
            graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law
            in 1978.
