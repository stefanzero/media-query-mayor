# Media Query Major

=====================

This project demonstrates the use of media queries to create a responsive web page about Mayor Ed Lee. The page layout adapts from a 2-column layout to a 1-column layout for narrow devices.

## Directory Structure

This directory contains multiple versions of the project, labeled `v0` to `v6`, each increasing in features and complexity.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase a simple web page about Mayor Ed Lee that utilizes media queries to adjust the layout based on screen size. The page features a brief biography and image of Mayor Ed Lee.

## Versions

This project is presented in a series of incremental versions, each building upon the previous one. Below is a brief description of each version:

- **`v0`: Foundation**: Empty HTML structure with basic setup, including loading of Google Fonts and Font Awesome, and a stylesheet that sets the default font.
- **`v1`: Content Addition**: All content and images are added, but without any styling.
- **`v2`: Basic Styling**: Initial CSS styling is applied, focusing on borders, margins, and padding.
- **`v3`: Responsive Images**: Responsive image styling is introduced, ensuring images adapt to different screen sizes.
- **`v4`: 2-Column Layout**: A 2-column layout is introduced, improving the overall structure of the page.
- **`v5`: Media Query Implementation**: A media query is used to switch to a 1-column layout for narrow devices, enhancing the page's responsiveness.
- **`v6`: Final Polish**: The final version, featuring a polished design and layout, with all elements working together seamlessly.

## Usage

1. Open the desired version of the project (e.g., `v6`) in a web browser.
2. Resize the browser window to observe the layout changes.
3. View the source code to see the media query implementation.
