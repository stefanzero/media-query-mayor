              Lee was born in 1952 in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Seattle,
              Washington. His parents immigrated to the United States from
              Taishan, Guangdong, China, in the 1930s. Lee's father, Gok Suey
              Lee, fought in the Korean War, worked as a cook, and managed a
              restaurant in Seattle. He died when Lee was 15. His mother was a
              seamstress and waitress. Lee had five siblings. He attended
              Franklin High School, before graduating summa cum laude from
              Bowdoin College in Maine in 1974, completed a year overseas as a
              Watson Fellow, and then graduated from the University of
              California, Berkeley, School of Law in 1978.
